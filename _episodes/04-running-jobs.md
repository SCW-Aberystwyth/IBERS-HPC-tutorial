# Working with the scheduler

The scheduler is responsible for listening to your job requests, then finding the proper compute node that meets your job's resource requirements -- RAM, number of cores, time, etc --. It dispatches the job to a compute node, collects info about the completed work, and stores information about your job. If you've asked it to do so, it will even notify you about the status of your job (e.g. begin, end, fail, etc).


## Running interactive jobs

There are two ways to run jobs on a cluster. One, usually done at the start, is to get an
interactive/foreground session on a compute node. This will give you a command prompt on a compute node and let you run the commands of your choice there.

If you want to experiment with some code and test it you should run it this way.

** Don't run jobs on the login nodes **


To get an interactive session, you first need to issue a `salloc` command to reserve some resources.

~~~
salloc --nodes=1 --partition=scw1389 --reservation=scw1389_13
~~~
{: .bash}

(You may need to replace `scw1389_13` with the reservation ID given by your instructor.)

The salloc command will respond now with a job ID number.

~~~
salloc: Granted job allocation 21712
salloc: Waiting for resource configuration
salloc: Nodes scs0018 are ready for job
~~~
{: .output}

We have now allocated ourselves a host to run a program on. The `-n 1` tells slurm how many copies of the task we will be running. The `--ntasks-per-node=1` tells slurm that we will just be running one task for every node we are allocated. We could increase either of these numbers if we want to run multiple copies of a task and if we want to run more than one copy per node.

To actually run a command we now need to issue the `srun` command. This also takes a `-n` parameter to tell Slurm how many copies of the job to run and it takes the name of the program to run. To run a job interactively we need another argument `--pty`.

~~~
srun --pty /bin/bash
~~~
{: .bash}


If you run command above you will see the hostname in the prompt change to the name of the compute node that slurm has allocated to you. In the example below the compute node is called `scs0018`.

~~~
[s.jane.doe@sl1 ~]$ srun --pty /bin/bash
[s.jane.doe@scs0018 ~]$
~~~
{: .output}

We are now logged into a compute node and can run any commands we wish and these will run on the compute node instead of the login node. You can also confirm the name of the host that you are connected to by running the `hostname` command.

~~~
hostname
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
scs0018
~~~
{: .output}


Once we are done working with the compute node we need to disconnect from it. The `exit` command will exit the bash program on the compute node causing us to disconnect. After this command is issued the hostname prompt should change back to the login node's name (e.g. sl1 or cl1).

~~~
[s.jane.doe@scs0018  ~]$ exit
exit
[s.jane.doe@sl1 ~]$
~~~
{: .output}

At this point we still hold an allocation for a node and could run another job if we wish. We can confirm this by examining the queue of our jobs with the `squeue` command. By default this will show all users' jobs, which is a bit overwhelming, so we can use `--user=` and our username to filter to our own jobs only.

~~~
squeue --user=s.jane.doe
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
           21712   compute     bash s.jane.doe  R       3:58      1 scs0018
~~~
{: .output}

To relinquish the node allocation we need to issue another exit command.

~~~
[s.jane.doe@sl1 ~]$ exit
~~~
{: .bash}

This will display a message that the job allocation is being relinquished and show us the same job ID number again.

~~~
exit
salloc: Relinquishing job allocation 21712
~~~
{: .output}

At this point our job is complete and we no longer hold any allocations. We can confirm this again with the `squeue` command.

~~~
[s.jane.doe@sl1 ~]$ squeue --user=s.jane.doe
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
~~~
{: .output}




## Running batch jobs

For most situations we won't want to run a job interactively, instead we will want to submit it to the cluster have it do its work and return any output files to us. We might submit many copies of the same job with different parameters in this way. This method of working is known as batch processing. To do this we must first write some details about our job into a script file. Use `nano` (or your favourite command line text editor) and create a file containing the following:

~~~
nano batchjob.sh
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
#!/bin/bash --login
###
# job name
#SBATCH --job-name=hostname
# job stdout file
#SBATCH --output=hostname.out.%J
# job stderr file
#SBATCH --error=hostname.err.%J
# maximum job time in D-HH:MM
#SBATCH --time=0-00:01
# maximum memory of 10 megabytes
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=10
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
# specify our current project
# change this for your own work
#SBATCH --account=scw1389
# specify the reservation we have for the training workshop
# remove this for your own work
#SBATCH --reservation=scw1389_13
###

/bin/hostname

~~~
{: .bash}

This is actually a bash script file containing all the commands that will be run. Lines beginning with a `#` are comments which bash will ignore. However lines that begin `#SBATCH` are instructions for the `sbatch` program. The first of these (`#SBATCH --job-name=hostname`) tells sbatch the name of the job, in this case we will call the job hostname. The `--output` line tells sbatch where output from the program should be sent, the `%J` in its name means the job number. The same applies for the `--error` line, except here it is for error messages that the program might generate, in most cases this file will be blank. The `--time` line limits how long the job can run for, this is specified in days, hours and minutes. The `--mem-per-cpu` tells Slurm how much memory to allow the job to use on each CPU it runs on, if the job exceeds this limit Slurm will automatically stop it. You can set this to zero for no limits. However by putting in a sensible number you can help allow other jobs to run on the same node. `--account` and `--reservation` tell Slurm to count usage against the project created for training workshops, and to use the nodes that have been reserved for today's training. (The value after `--reservation` changes for each workshop; your instructor will give you a value to use.) The final line specifies the actual commands which will be executed, in this case its the `hostname` command which will tell us the name of the compute node which ran our job.

> ## Running on your own
>
> If you are following this guide outside of a training workshop, or want to adjust the script to use in your own research,
> you will need to remove the `--reservation` line, since there won't be a reservation in place, and change `--account` to

{: .callout}

Lets go ahead and submit this job with the `sbatch` command.

~~~
[s.jane.doe@sl1 ~]$ sbatch batchjob.sh
~~~
{: .bash}


sbatch will respond with the number of the job.

~~~
Submitted batch job 3739464
~~~
{: .output}

Our job should only take a couple of seconds to run, but if we are fast we might see it in the `squeue` list.

~~~
[s.jane.doe@sl1 ~]$ squeue --user=s.jane.doe
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
           3739464      work hostname jane.doe  R       0:01      1 scs0018
~~~
{: .output}

Once the job is completed two new files should be created, one called `hostname.out.3739464` and one called `hostname.err.3739464`. The `.out` file is the output from the command we ran and the `.err` is the errors from that command. Your job files will have different names as they will contain the job ID you were allocated and not `3739464`. Lets go ahead and look at the `.out` file:

~~~
[s.jane.doe@sl1 ~]$ cat hostname.out.373464
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
scs0018
~~~
{: .output}

If we check the `.err` file it should be blank:

~~~
[s.jane.doe@sl1 ~]$ cat hostname.err.373464
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
~~~
{: .output}


### Over-riding the sbatch options from the command line

As well as specifying options to sbatch in the batch file, they can specified on the command line too.
Lets edit our batch file to run the command `/bin/sleep 70` before `/bin/hostname`, this will cause it to wait for 70 seconds before exiting. As our job has a one minute limit this should fail and the hostname output will never happen.


~~~
[s.jane.doe@sl1 ~]$ nano batchjob.sh
~~~
{: .bash}


Edit the script to have the command `/bin/sleep 70` before the `hostname` command.
~~~
#!/bin/bash --login
###
# job name
#SBATCH --job-name=hostname
# job stdout file
#SBATCH --output=hostname.out.%J
# job stderr file
#SBATCH --error=hostname.err.%J
# maximum job time in D-HH:MM
#SBATCH --time=0-00:01
# maximum memory of 10 megabytes
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=10
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --nodes=1
# specify our current project
# change this for your own work
#SBATCH --account=scw1389
# specify the reservation we have for the training workshop
# remove this for your own work
#SBATCH --reservation=scw1389_13
###

/bin/sleep 70
/bin/hostname
~~~
{: .bash}


Now lets resubmit the job.

~~~
[s.jane.doe@sl1 ~]$  sbatch batchjob.sh
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
Submitted batch job 3739465
~~~
{: .output}

After approximately one minute the job will disappear from the `squeue` output, but this time the `.out` file should be empty and the `.err` file will contain an error message saying the job was cancelled:

~~~
[s.jane.doe@sl1 ~]$  cat hostname.err.3739465
~~~
{: .bash}


~~~
slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 3739465 ON scs0018 CANCELLED AT 2017-12-06T16:45:38 DUE TO TIME LIMIT ***
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
[s.jane.doe@sl1 ~]$ cat hostname.out.3739465
~~~
{: .bash}


~~~
~~~
{: .output}



Now lets override the time limit by giving the parameter `--time 0-0:2` to sbatch, this will set the time limit to two minutes and the job should complete.

~~~
[s.jane.doe@sl1 ~]$ sbatch --time 0-0:2 batchjob.sh
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
 Submitted batch job 3739466
~~~
{: .output}

After approximately 70 seconds the job will disappear from the squeue list and this we should have nothing in the `.err` file and a hostname in the `.out` file.

~~~
[s.jane.doe@sl1 ~]$ cat hostname.err.3739466
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
~~~
{: .output}


~~~
[s.jane.doe@sl1 ~]$ cat hostname.out.3739466
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
scs0018
~~~
{: .output}


### Cancelling jobs

The `scancel` command can be used to cancel a job after its submitted. Lets go ahead and resubmit the job we just used.

~~~
[s.jane.doe@sl1 ~]$  sbatch batchjob.sh
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
Submitted batch job 3739467
~~~
{: .output}


Now (within 60 seconds) lets cancel the job.


~~~
[s.jane.doe@sl1 ~]$  scancel 3739467
~~~
{: .bash}

This will cancel the job, `squeue` will now show no record of it and there won't be a `.out` or `.err` file for it.


### Listing jobs that have run

The `sacct` command lists all the jobs you have run. By default this shows the Job ID, the Job Name, partition, Account, number of CPUs used, the state of the job and how long it ran for.

~~~
[s.jane.doe@sl1 ~]$  sacct
~~~
{: .bash}


~~~
       JobID    JobName  Partition    Account  AllocCPUS      State ExitCode
------------ ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- --------
21713              bash    compute    scw1000          1  COMPLETED      0:0
21713.extern     extern               scw1000          1  COMPLETED      0:0
21713.0            bash               scw1000          1  COMPLETED      0:0
21714              bash    compute    scw1000          1  COMPLETED      0:0
21714.extern     extern               scw1000          1  COMPLETED      0:0
21714.0            bash               scw1000          1  COMPLETED      0:0
21716          hostname    compute    scw1000          1  COMPLETED      0:0
21716.batch       batch               scw1000          1  COMPLETED      0:0
21716.extern     extern               scw1000          1  COMPLETED      0:0
~~~
{: .output}

In the output above the account is the project you are associated with. scw1000 is the RSE project. You'll probably see a different project account here.


> ## Using the `sbatch` command.
> 1. Write a submission script to run the hostname command on one node, with one core using one megabyte of RAM and a maximum run time of one minute. Have it save its output to hostname.out.%J and errors to hostname.err.%J.
> 2. Run your script using `sbatch`
> 3. Examine the output file, which host did it run on?
> 4. Try running it again, did your command run on the same host?
> 5. Now add the command `/bin/sleep 70` before the line running hostname in the script. Run the job again and examine the output of `squeue` as it runs. How many seconds does the job run for before it ends? Hint: the command `watch -n 1 squeue` will run squeue every second and show you the output. Press CTRL+C to stop it.
> 6. What is in the .err file, why did you script exit? Hint: if it wasn't due to the time expiring try altering another parameter so it is due a time expiration.

## Running multiple copies of a job with Srun

So far we've only run a single copy of a program. Often we'll need to run multiple copies of something. To do this we can combine the `sbatch` and `srun` commands. Instead of just placing the command at the end of the script we'll `srun` the command.
This will allow multiple copies of the command to run. In the example below two copies of the hostname command are run on two different nodes.

~~~
#!/bin/bash --login
###
# job name
#SBATCH --job-name=hostname
# job stdout file
#SBATCH --output=hostname.out.%J
# job stderr file
#SBATCH --error=hostname.err.%J
# maximum job time in D-HH:MM
#SBATCH --time=0-00:01
# maximum memory of 10 megabytes
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=10
#SBATCH --ntasks=2
#SBATCH --nodes=2
# specify our current project
# change this for your own work
#SBATCH --account=scw1389
# specify the reservation we have for the training workshop
# remove this for your own work
#SBATCH --reservation=scw1389_13
###

srun /bin/hostname
~~~
{: .bash}

Save this as job.sh and run it with sbatch

~~~
[s.jane.doe@sl1 ~]$ sbatch job.sh
~~~
{: .bash}

The output will now go into hostname.out.jobnumber and should contain two different hostnames.


## Job Arrays

Job Arrays are another method for running multiple copies of the same job. The `--array` parameter to sbatch allows us to make use of this feature.

~~~
[s.jane.doe@sl1 ~]$ sbatch --array=0-2 batchjob.sh
~~~
{: .bash}

The above command will submit **three** copies of the batchjob.sh command.

~~~
[s.jane.doe@sl1 ~]$ squeue --user=s.jane.doe
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER   ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
         3739590_0   compute hostname s.jane.doe  R       0:01      1 scs0018
         3739590_1   compute hostname s.jane.doe  R       0:01      1 scs0018
         3739590_2   compute hostname s.jane.doe  R       0:01      1 scs0096
~~~
{: .bash}

Running `squeue` as this is happening will show three distinct jobs, each with an _ followed by a number on the end of their job ID. When the jobs are complete there will be three output and three err files all with the job ID and the job array number.

~~~
[s.jane.doe@sl1 ~]$ ls -rt | tail -6
hostname.out.3739592.scs0018
hostname.out.3739591.scs0018
hostname.out.3739590.scs0096
hostname.err.3739590.scs0096
hostname.err.3739592.scs0018
hostname.err.3739591.scs0018
~~~
{: .bash}

Its possible for programs to get hold of their array number from the `$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID` environment variable. If we add the command `echo $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID` to our batch script then it will be possible to see this in the output file.


## Choosing the proper resources for your job

When you submit a job, you are requesting resources from the scheduler to run your job. These are:
* time
* memory
* Number of cores (CPUs)
* Number of nodes
* (sort of) queue or group of machines to use

Choosing resources is like playing a game with the scheduler: You want to request enough to get your job completed without failure, But request too much: your job is "bigger" and thus harder to schedule. Request too little: if your job goes over that requested, it is killed. So you want to get it just right, and pad a little for wiggle room.

Another way to think of 'reserving' a compute node for you job is like making a reservation at a restaurant:
* if you bring more guests to your dinner, there won't be room at the restaurant, but the wait staff may try to fit them in. If so, things will be more crowded and the kitchen (and the whole restaurant) may slow down dramatically
* if you bring fewer guests and don't notify the staff in advance, the extra seats are wasted; no one else can take the empty places, and the restaurant may lose money.

Never use a piece of software for the first time without looking to see what command-line options are available and what default parameters are being used
	-- acgt.me · by Keith Bradnam
	
### Time
This is determined by test runs that you do on your code during an interactive session.
Or, if you submit a batch job, over-ask first, check the amount of time actually needed,
then reduce time on later runs. **SCW has a limit of three days maximum to run a job**

**Please!** Due to scheduler overhead, bundle commands for minimum of 10 minutes / job

### Memory:
We recommend that you check the software docs for memory requirements. But often times these are not stated, so we can take another approach. On HPCW, each job is allowed, on average, 3 GB RAM/core allocated. So, try 3 GB and do a trial run via `srun` or `sbatch`. If you're job was killed, look at your log files or `sacct`. If it shows a memory error, you went over. Ask for more and try again.

Once the job has finished, ask the scheduler how much RAM was used by using the `sacct` command to get post-run job info:

~~~
sacct -j JOBID --format=JobID,JobName,ReqMem,MaxRSS,Elapsed # RAM requested/used!!
~~~
{: .bash}

The `ReqMem` field is how much you asked for and `MaxRSS` is how much was actually used. Now go back and adjust your RAM request in your sbatch command or submission script.


### Number of Cores
You can tell Slurm how many cores you expect your software to use with the `-n` or `--ntasks` arguments. **Setting this to more than one doesn't cause multiple copies of your job to run**.
This is determined by your software, how anxious you are to get the work done, and how well your code scales. **NOTE! Throwing more cores at a job does not make it run faster!** This is a common mistake and will waste compute time and prevent other users from running jobs. Ensure your software can use multiple cores: Inspect the parameters for your software and look for options such as 'threads', 'processes', 'cpus'; this will often indicate that it has been parallelized. Then run test jobs to see how well it performs with multiple cores, inching slowing from 1 to 2, 4, 8, etc, assessing the decrease in time for the job run as you increase cores. Programs often do not scale well -- it's important to understand this so you can choose the appropriate number.

### Number of Nodes
For most software, this choice is simple: 1. There are *very* few software packages capable of running across multiple nodes. If they are capable, they will probably mention the use of technology called 'MPI' or 'openMPI'. Please talk to your local SCW staff about how to run this. If you wish to set this use the `--nodes` or `-N` options to sbatch.

### Partitions (Queues)

Partitions, or queues, are a grouping of computers to run a certain profile of jobs. This could be maximum run time, # of cores used, amount of max RAM, etc. On HPCW each unique configuration of systems has its own partition. Earlier on we used the `sinfo` command to list the state of the cluster, one of the parameters this showed was the name of the parititons.

Here is the output of `sinfo` on Sunbird in Swansea.

~~~
PARTITION AVAIL  TIMELIMIT  NODES  STATE NODELIST
compute*     up 3-00:00:00      1   fail scs0042
compute*     up 3-00:00:00      1 drain* scs0004
compute*     up 3-00:00:00      2    mix scs[0018,0065]
compute*     up 3-00:00:00     84  alloc scs[0001-0003,0005-0017,0020-0035,0043-0046,0049-0064,0066-0072,0097-0114,0116-0122]
compute*     up 3-00:00:00     34   idle scs[0019,0036-0041,0047-0048,0073-0096,0115]
gpu          up 2-00:00:00      4   idle scs[2001-2004]
~~~
{: .output}

The partition name is listed in the first column. The `*` next to the work partition denotes that it is the default. We can see that in total it contains 162 nodes. Each of these has 36GB of RAM and 12 Westmere cores. The `Large` partition only contains four nodes but each of these have 128GB of RAM and the older Nehalem processors. Finally the `vlarge` partition only contains one node, but this has 512GB of RAM and a Nehalem processor.

We can specify which partition a job runs in with the `-p` or `--partition` arguments to `sbatch`. So for example the following command will run our batch job on the compute partition.

~~~
sbatch --partition compute batchjob.sh
~~~
{: .bash}

We could also add the following line to the batch submission script.

~~~
#SBATCH --partition compute
~~~
{:  .bash}


### Email Alerts from Slurm

You can receive email alerts when your job begins and ends by adding the following to your Slurm script. Set `--mail-type` to `END` if you just want to be alerted about jobs completing.

~~~
#SBATCH --mail-user=abc1@aber.ac.uk
#SBATCH --mail-type=ALL
~~~
{: .bash}
