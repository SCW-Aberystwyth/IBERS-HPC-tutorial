The key points were, that `inside_circle` consumed the majority of the runtime (99%). Even more so, the generation of random numbers consumed the most parts of the runtime (73%). 

More over, the generation of random numbers in x and in y is independent (two seperate lines of code). So there is another way to expliot data independence:

> ## Numpy madness
>
> Numpy is a great library for doing numerical computations in python (this where its name originates). In terms of readability however, the numpy syntax does somewhat obscure what is happening under the hood. For example:
>
> ~~~~~
> a = np.random.uniform(size=10)
> b = np.random.uniform(size=10)
> 
> c = a + b
> ~~~~~
> 
> First of, `np.random.uniform(size=10)` creates a list of 10 random numbers. Cross check this by printing it to the terminal. 
>
> Second, `c = a + b` refers to the plus operation performed item by item of the participating arrays or lists. It can be rewritten as:
>
> ~~~~~
> for i in range(len(a)):
>   c[i] = a[i] + b[i]

{: .callout}


Another approach is trying to compute as many independent parts as possible in parallel. In this case here, we can make the observation that each pair of numbers in `x` and `y` is independent of each other. 

![Illustration of drawing random number pairs `x` and `y` and their dependency with respect to the pair generated]({{ page.root }}/fig/data_pairs_parallel_estimate_pi.svg)

This behavior is often referred to as _data parallelism_.

She discusses this > with her office mate over lunch. Her colleaque mentions that this type of consideration was first discussed by Gene Amdahl in 1967 and goes by the name of [Amdahl's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law). This law provides a simple of mean of calculating how fast a program can get when parallelized for a fixed problem size. By profiling her code, Lola has all the ingredients to make this calculation. 
> The performance improvement of a program, given an original implementation and an improved one is referred as __speed-up S__. Given a program, we can measure the runtime portion of the code that can be benefit from use of more resources (in our case parallel computations), aka __parallel portion p__. For this __parallel portion__, we finally need how much this can be sped-up, which we will refer to as __serial speed-up s__.

> The parallel portion of these two operations amounts to `37+36=73%` of the overall runtime, i.e. `p = 73% = 0.73`. As we want to make the generation of random numbers in x to one task and the generation of random numbers in y to another one, the speed-up `s = 2`.

So the bottom line(s) of Amdahl's law are:

- we can speed up a program if we drive `p` as close as possible towards `1`, in other words we should try to parallelize at best the entire program 
- we can speed up a program if we drive `s` to a large number, in other words we should find ways to speed-up portions of the code as best as possible
- there is a limit to the speed-up that we can achieve

> ## Surprise! More limits.

> Until here `s` was of a bit dubious nature. It was a proprerty of the parallel implementation of our code. In practise, this number is not only limited algorithmically, but also by the hardware your code is running on.

> When a program wants to perform a computation, it most of the time reads in some data, stores it in memory (RAM) and performs computations on it using the CPU. Modern CPUs can do more than one thing at a time, mostly because they consist of more than one "device" than can perform a computation. This "device" is called a CPU core. When we want to perform some tasks in parallel to one another, the amout of work that can be done in parallel is limited by the amount of CPU cores that can perform computations. So, the number of CPU cores is the hard limit for parallelizing any computation.

Keeping this in mind, Lola decides to split up the work for multiple cores requires Lola to split up the number of total samples by the number of cores available and calling `inside_circle` on each of these partitions:

![Partitioning `x` and `y`]({{ page.root }}/fig/partition_data_parallel_estimate_pi.svg)

The number of partitions has to be limited by the number of CPU cores available. With this in mind, the `estimate_pi` method can be converted to run in parallel. The `estimate_pi` function takes an argument `core_count` which tells it how many CPU cores and partitions to use. 


~~~
import numpy as np

def estimate_pi(total_count,core_count):

    count = pymp.shared.array((core_count,), dtype='int32')

    with pymp.Parallel(core_count) as p:
        for i in p.range(0,core_count):
            local_count = inside_circle(int(total_count/core_count))

            with p.lock:
                count[i] = local_count

    return (4.0 * sum(count) / total_count)
~~~
{: .python}

PyMP is a Python module based on a popular program called OpenMP that's available in many languages (but not Python). OpenMP and PyMP let you create parallel loops where all or a number of the iterations of the loop are run at once. Another way to build parallel code is to split a program into multiple concurrent threads, but this normally requires more extra code than OpenMP/PyMP does. 

Install the `pymp` module by running the command:

~~~
$ pip3 install --user pymp-pypi
~~~
{: .bash}

One thing we must be cautious of when writing parallel code is what happens when two (or more) threads try to update the same variable at the same time. OpenMP and PyMP let us specify that a variable is private and each thread will get its own copy or shared where there is only one copy. The access to a shared variable can be locked so that any thread wanting to use it has to wait for the others to finish. In the above example we create a shared variable called `count` which is an array with an element for each thread. The access to this locked so that one one thread can write to it at a time. Each thread has its own private variable called `local_count`, this is so that we spend the minimum amount of time in the locked section. 


![Partitioning `x` and `y` and results of reach partition]({{ page.root }}/fig/partition_data_parallel_estimate_pi_with_results.svg)

The last step required before calculating pi is to collect the individual results from the `partitions` and _reduce_ it to one `total_count` of those random number pairs that were inside of the circle. Here the `sum` function loops over `partitions` and does exactly that. So let's run our [parallel implementation]({{ page.root }}/code/pymp_numpi.py) and see what it gives:

~~~
$ module load hpcw
$ module load python/3.5.1
$ wget https://supercomputingwales.github.io/SCW-tutorial/code/pymp_numpi.py
$ python3 ./pymp_numpi.py 1000000000
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
[pymp version] [using 8 cores ] pi is 3.141840 from 1000000000 samples
~~~
{: .output}

The good news is, the parallel implementation is correct. It estimates Pi to equally bad precision than our serial implementation. The question remains, did we gain anything? For this, Lola tries to the `time` system utility that can be found on all *nix installations and most certainly on compute clusters.

~~~
$ time python3 ./serial_numpi.py 1000000000

~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
[serial version] required memory 11444.092 MB
[serial version] pi is 3.141557 from 1000000000 samples

real    4m16.287s

~~~

real    0m56.505s
user    0m5.252s
sys     6m56.126s
~~~
{: .output}

If the snipped from above is compared to the snippets earlier, you can see that `time` has been put before any other command executed at the prompt and 3 lines have been added to the output of our program. `time` reports 3 times and they are all different:

  - `real` that denotes the time that has passed during our program as if you would have used a stop watch
  - `user` this is accumulated amount of CPU seconds (so seconds that the CPU was active) spent in code by the user (you)
  - `sys`  this is accumulated amount of CPU seconds that the CPU spent while executing system code that was necessary to run your program (memory management, display drivers if needed, interactions with the disk, etc.)
    
So from the above, Lola wants to compare the `real` time spent by her serial implementation (`4m16`) and compare it to the `real` time spent by her parallel implementation (`0m56.505s`). Apparently, her parallel program was `4.57` times faster than the serial implementation. 

We can compare this to the maximum speed-up that is achievable: `S = 1/(1 - 0.99 + 0.99/8) = 7.48`
That means, our parallel implementation does already a good job, but only achieves `100*4.57/7.48 = 61.1%` runtime improvement of what is possible. As achieving maximum speed-up is hardly ever possible, Lola leaves that as a good end of the day and leaves for home.

> ## Adding up times
> The output of the `time` command is very much bound to how a operating system works. In an ideal world, `user` and `sys` of serial programs should add up to `real`. Typically they never do. The reason is, that the operating systems used in HPC and on laptops or workstations are set up in a way, that the operating system decides which process receives time on the CPU (aka to perform computations). Once a process runs, it may however happen, that the system decides to intervene and have some other binary have a tiny slice of a CPU second while your application is executed. This is where the mismatch for `user+sys` and `real` comes from.
> Note also how the `user` time of the parallel program is a lot larger than the time that was actually consumed. This is because, `time` reports accumulated timings i.e. it adds up CPU seconds that were consumed in parallel.

> ## Hyperthreading
> Hyperthreading is an extension found in some CPUs where some parts of the CPU core are duplicated. These appear to most programs as extra cores and can cause core counts to be reported as double what they really are. 
> The performance boost of Hyperthreading varies between a small performance reduction and 15-30%. When performing identical simple tasks on every CPU as in our example there is unlikely to be any performance gain.
> On Linux systems the `lscpu` command will display information about the CPU including the number of threads, cores and CPUs. The line "Thread(s) per core" will be 1 if there's no Hyperthreading and 2 or more if there is.

> ## Parallel for real 1
>
> What of the following is a task, that can be parallelized in real life:
> 
> 1. Manually copying a book and producing a clone 
> 2. Clearing the table after dinner
> 3. Rinsing the dishes 
> 4. A family getting dressed to leave the appartment for birthday party
>
> > ## Solution
> > 1. not parallel as we have to start with one book and only have one reader/writer
> > 2. parallel, the more people help, the better
> > 3. not parallel, as we typically only have one sink
> > 4. parallel, each family member can get dressed independent of each other

> ## Parallel for real 2
>
> What of the following is a task, that can be parallelized in real life:
> 
> 1. Compressing the contents of a directory full of files
> 2. Converting the currency of rows in a column of a large spreadsheet (10 million rows)
> 3. Writing an e-mail in an online editor
> 4. Playing a Video on youtube/vimeo/etc. or in a video player application
>
> > ## Solution
> > 1. parallel, each file can be compressed seperately
> > 2. parallel, each row can be converted seperately
> > 3. not parallel, we only have one writer (you)
> > 4. not parallel, you only have one consumer (you), rendering the movie in 2 windows in parallel does not help
