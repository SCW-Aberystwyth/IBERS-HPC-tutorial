# Optimising for Parallel Processing


## Running a job on multiple cores

By default most programs will only run one job per node, but all Super Computing Wales nodes have multiple CPU cores and are capable of running multiple processes at once without (much) loss of performance. 

A crude way to achieve this is to have our job submission script just run multiple processes and background each one with the `&` operator.

~~~
#!/bin/bash --login
###
#job name
#SBATCH --job-name=test
#SBATCH --output=test.out.%J
#SBATCH --error=test.err.%J
#SBATCH --time=0-00:01
#SBATCH --ntasks=3
#SBATCH --account=scwXXXX
#SBATCH --reservation=scwXXXX_Y
###

command1 &
command2 &
command3 
~~~
{: .bash}

This will run command1,2 and 3 simultaneously. It also requests 3 cores with the ntasks option.

When command3 finishes the job will end as backgrounded jobs won't keep the job running. An alternative to this is to put a long sleep command in as the last statement, but we need to get the timing accurate for this. If all the commands finish and the sleep is still running we'll be reserving resources we aren't using.

This method has its limits if we want to run multiple tasks after the first ones have completed. Its possible, but scaling it will be harder.


## GNU Parallel

GNU Parallel is a utility specially designed to run multiple parallel jobs. It can execute a set number of tasks at a time and when they are complete run more tasks.

GNU Parallel can be loaded a module called "parallel". Its syntax is a bit complex, but its very powerful. 


### A simple GNU Parallel example

For this example we'll just run on a quick test on the head node. First we have to load the module for parallel. This is only available via the legacy HPC Wales modules which have to be activated by loading the module called "hpcw". 

`module load hpcw parallel`

> ## Citing Software
> Each time you run GNU parallel it will remind that you academic tradition requires you to cite the software you used. You can stop this message by running `parallel --citation` once and parallel will then remember not to show this message anymore. Running this will also show you the Bibtex code for citing parallel in your papers. 
{: .callout}

The command below will run ls to list all the files in the current directory and it will send the list of files to parallel. Parallel will in turn run the echo command on each input it was given. The `{1}` means to use the first argument (and in this case its the only one) as the parameter to the echo command.

`ls | parallel echo {1}`

As a short hand we could have also run the command

`ls | parallel echo` 

and it would produce the same output.

An alternate syntax for the same command is:

`parallel echo {1} ::: $(ls)`

Here we specify what command to run first and the put the data to process second, after the `:::`. 


> ## Excercise: parallelising Nelle's pipeline
> Nelle is a researcher who featuerd in the Software Carpentry [Unix Shell lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/). She is studying the North Pacfici Gyre and has 1520 data files, each of which measure the  abundnace of 300 different proteins. Each file is named NENE followed by a 5 digit number identifying the sample and finally an A or a B to identify which of two machines analysed the sample. 
>
> First we need to download Nelle's data from the Software Carpentry website. This can be downloaded with the wget command, the files then need to be extracted from the zip archive with the unzip command. 
> 
> ~~~
> wget http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/data/data-shell.zip
> unzip data-shell.zip
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
> 
> The data we'll be using is now extracted into the directory data-shell/north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03
> 
> `cd data-shell/north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03/`
>
> Nelle needs to run a program called `goostats` on each file to process it. During the Unix Shell lesson this data was processed in series by the following set of commands:
> 
> ~~~
> # Calculate stats for data files.
> for datafile in $(ls NENE*[AB].txt)
> do
>     echo $datafile
>     bash goostats $datafile stats-$datafile
> done
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
>
> The `ls NENE*[AB].txt` command lists all the files which start with "NENE" and end either A.txt or B.txt. The for loop will work through the list of files produced by ls one by one and runs goostats on each one. 
>
> Convert this process to run in parallel by using GNU Parallel instead. 
>
> > ## Solution

### Running Parallel under Slurm

First lets create a job submission script and call it `parallel.sh`.

~~~
#!/bin/bash --login
###
#SBATCH --ntasks 4                     #Number of processors we will use
#SBATCH --nodes 1                      #request everything runs on the same node
#SBATCH -o output.%J              #Job output
#SBATCH -t 00:01:00               #Max wall time for entire job
#SBATCH --account=scwXXXX
#SBATCH --reservation=scwXXXX_Y
###

#parallel is only available as a legacy HPC Wales module
#running module load hpcw makes all the legacy modules available to us
module load hpcw
module load parallel

# Define srun arguments:
srun="srun -n1 -N1" 
# -N1 -n1         allocates a single core to each task

# Define parallel arguments:
parallel="parallel -j $SLURM_NTASKS --joblog parallel_joblog"
# -j $SLURM_NTASKS  is the number of concurrent tasks parallel runs, so number of CPUs allocated
# --joblog name     parallel's log file of tasks it has run

# Run the tasks:
ls NENE*[AB].txt | $parallel "$srun bash ./goostats {1} stats-{1}"
~~~
{: .bash}


Now lets go ahead and run the job by using `sbatch` to submit `parallel.sh`. 

~~~
sbatch parallel.sh
~~~
{: .bash}

This will take a minute or so to run. If we watch the output of `sacct` we should see 15 subjobs being created.

### More complex command handling with Parallel

We can run parallel with multiple arguments. For example `parallel echo "hello {1} {2}" ::: 1 2 3 ::: a b c`

Which runs each possible combination of the first and second arguments to give:

~~~
hello 1 a
hello 1 b
hello 1 c
hello 2 a
hello 2 b
hello 2 c
hello 3 a
hello 3 b
hello 3 c
~~~
{: .output}

If we only want to run each argument as a pair, so there are only three outputs adding the `+` symbol to the end of the second `:::` will achieve this:

~~~
parallel echo "hello {1} {2}" ::: 1 2 3 :::+ a b c

hello world 1 a
hello world 2 b
hello world 3 c
~~~
{: .output}
